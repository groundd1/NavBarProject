# Navbar Component

This project is a simple example of a Flask web application demonstrating the use of a basic navigation bar component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Description
The project consists of the following files:

main.py: Flask application with three routes (/, /about, /phone) to render different pages.
styles.css: CSS file containing styles for the navigation bar and page content.
script.js: JavaScript file for additional client-side functionality (currently logging a message to the console).
HTML templates (index.html, about.html, phone.html) for the respective pages, each including a navigation bar and content section.
